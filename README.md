# sui-dapp-starter

Better full-stack Sui dapp starter

## Motivation

I took the [official Sui e2e starter template](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/create-dapp) and tried to develop with it. 
It's a good starting point and it just works but it's also very basic. 

While working with the official starter, I came up with a list of DX improvements, which I decided to wrap into a separate starter template.

## Improvements (over the official starter template)

- [x] Implemented a monorepo architecture with pnpm workspaces
- [x] Added recommenced VSCode plugins through VSCode configuration
- [ ] ...

## Prerequisites
